##### Technology expertise in Node.js
- Built a [command line tool](https://gist.github.com/raisfathin/8f1a7e8d322a53e4ba29) to verify a program's correctness based on some test cases. It can notify whether the tested program's output matches the corresponding expected output for each input, or whether the program encounters a run time error. [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/ZPJtUNX)

##### Technology expertise in Web Security
**Short-Term Plan** 

To expose myself to various aspects of Web Security by joining an interest group for cyber security and attempting CTF problems on Web security. 

**Long-Term Plan** 

Firstly, I intend to gain a deeper understanding web-related technologies, so that I will be able to understand how web security fit into the big picture. I also intend to learn more about web security by taking modules on Web Security such as CS5331 and internship at a companies doing work related to web security.
